# Social Network Api

## Description

As a developer working on a social media platform, I needed a way to manage my users, as well as their Thoughts and Reactions via API.
This application serves as a way to interact with my NoSQL MongoDB to create, update, and delete resources as needed.

In building this out, my understanding of NoSQL databases was solidified, and I feel confident in building a modularized solution leveraging API routes and models using mongoose!
